# DL-BUG-FINDER
Responsible for finding the location of potential violations in the TensorFlow API. Our current plan is this component will utilize a dataset of common Tensorflow misuses to better identify bug patterns. It will then use Tensorflow misuse-guided searching to find the location and code of likely Tensorflow APIs usage issues. It will then create a report of the identified bug and sent it to the next component.
